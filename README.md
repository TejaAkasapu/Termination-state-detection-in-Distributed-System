# Termination-state-detection-in-Distributed-System
The project aims to simulate communication between ‘N’ worker processes and a detector process.
Termination occurs when all processes are idle, and no message is in transit. Used TLA+ and PlusCal for modelling the system. FIFO channels were used to capture the messages at each process.
